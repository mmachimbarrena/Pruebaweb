	abstract = {This study explores the psychometric properties of the Cyberbullying Triangulation Questionnaire (CTQ), which measures and triangulates the roles of cybervictimization, cyberaggression, and cyberbystanding. The study sample was composed of 5,036 Spanish students with a mean age of 14.19 years (SD = Æ1.7; range = 10–23 years). Conﬁrmatory factor analysis of the three correlated-factor model yielded a high goodness of ﬁt. Reliability as measured by Omega coefﬁcients was adequate ({\textgreater}0.94). The measurement model was invariant for the two age groups (10–14 years and 15–23 years). Cybervictimization and cyberaggression correlated with ofﬂine victimization and aggression (r = 0.49; p {\textless} 0.001; r = 0.57; p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). The results show that the most prevalent cyberbystanding subrole was that of the Defender of the Victim (54.6\%), and that cyberaggression and cyberbystanding were more prevalent among male adolescents (p {\textless} 0.001). The lack of parental control over children’s use of the mobile phone was associated with cyberaggression (p {\textless} 0.001).},

	abstract = {Purpose  Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been analyzed in relation to multiple psychosocial and health problems. However, only a few studies have analyzed the impact of bullying and cyberbullying on HRQoL. The main purpose of this study was to analyze the level of severity of bullying and cyberbullying on HRQoL. The effects of different roles, especially the conjunctions of of victim–cybervictim and bully–victim/cyberbully–cybervictim on HRQoL, were explored.
Methods  An analytical and cross-sectional study was conducted in a region of northern Spain. Random and representative sampling was employed. The participants included 12, 285 adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age, with a mean age of 14.69 ± 1.73. The Spanish version of the KIDSCREEN-27, the Spanish version of the European bullying intervention project questionnaire (EBIPQ), and the cyberbullying triangulation questionnaire (CTQ) were employed.
Results  The prevalence of bullying victimization, cybervictimization, bullying perpetration, and cyberbullying perpetration was 12\%, 8.1\%, 10.4\%, and 7\%, respectively. Significant and negative correlations between all the dimensions of the EBIPQ and the CTQ with the KIDSCREEN-27 were found. Victimization and cybervictimization had more impact than bullying perpetration and cyberbullying perpetration, especially on psychological well-being and school environment. The mixed roles of the victim–cybervictim and victim–cybervictim/bully–cyberbully obtained lower scores than the remaining roles in all the dimensions of KIDSCREEN-27.
Conclusions  Those in mixed roles related to victimization and cybervictimization obtained the lowest scores in all HRQoL dimensions. The results enhance an understanding of the severity of the problem of bullying and cyberbullying and their impact on HRQoL.},

Grounded on the cumulative risk theory, the objective of this study was to analyze the differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) depending on the accumulation of several psychosocial risks (bullying, cyberbullying, cyberdating abuse, sexting, online grooming, and problematic Internet use). The participants were 3,212 Spanish adolescents (53.7\% females) with a mean age of 13.92 ± 1.44, who completed self-report online questionnaires that assessed each of the aforementioned risks and HRQoL. Overall, 41.4\% of the female participants and 36.8\% of the males presented at least one risk, with significant differences between sexes. The percentage of participants who presented an accumulation of three or more risks was 8.2\%. Risk accumulation was related to a lower HRQoL score than those who presented no risks. The scores in HRQoL decrease at up to four risks, point at which the differences ceased to be significant.},

	abstract = {Nomophobia is a situational phobia leading to a deep, irrational, and disproportionate fear of not being able to use the smartphone. An instrumental study on the Spanish version of the Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q) was carried out. The objectives were: 1) To analyse its factor structure and reliability; 2) to test for the invariance of sex and age groups, and 3) to obtain specific cut-off points by sex and age non-existent to date. Sampling was incidental and non-probabilistic with 5012 participants (57.9\%, females) aged 12-24 years (M = 18.04, SD = 3.3). The confirmatory factor analysis revealed a hierarchical model with four correlated factors explained by a general second-order factor. The internal validity and reliability values of the NMP-Q dimensions are satisfactory, ranging between .78, .85, .86, and .92 (Omega w). A multigroup analysis confirmed the invariance across sex and age groups. Building on the NMP-Q scores, we calculated 3 cut-off points using percentiles 15th, 80th and 95th (unnomophobic, at risk of nomophobia, and nomophobic). Females aged 12-15 years had the highest nomophobic scores. We can conclude that the proposed sex and age cut-off points will allow us to better identify nomophobic problems from a clinical point of view.},

	abstract = {Online gaming is a very common form of leisure among adolescents and young people, although its excessive and/or compulsive use is associated with psychological impairments in a minority of gamers. The latest (fifth) edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5, Section III) tentatively introduced Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD). Since then, a number of evaluation tools using the DSM-5 criteria have been developed, including the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale–Short Form (IGDS9-SF). The main objective of this study was to translate and adapt the IGDS9-SF into Spanish, as well as to obtain indicators relating to its validity and reliability. The Spanish version of four scales were administered: IGDS9-SF, Mobile Phone-Related Experiences Questionnaire (CERM), Online Gambling Disorder Questionnaire (OGD-Q), and KIDSCREEN-27. The sample comprised 535 Vocational Training students (mean age 18.35 years; SD±2.13; 78.5\% males) who reported playing video games in the past 12 months. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded a one-dimensional model with a good fit while the reliability indicators were satisfactory. Findings indicated that 1.9\% of gamers were classified with IGD (meeting five or more criteria for more than 12 months). Additionally, another 1.9\% were considered gamers ‘at-risk’ because they endorsed four criteria. Positive and significant relationships were found between the IGDS9-SF, the CERM, and the OGD-Q. Participants classified with IGD had poorer health-related quality of life. In conclusion, the Spanish IGDS9-SF is a valid and reliable instrument to assess IGD according to the DSM-5.},

PRISMA protocol for systematic reviews was used in all documents registered in the main psychology databases featuring the keywords bullying/cyberbullying and family/parents, between 2004 and 2017. Seventy-four articles met the inclusion criteria. Results. The review revealed the following familiar variables associated with each role. Victims of bullying: authoritarian, punitive, negligent, or permissive parents; dysfunctional homes, low family harmony, conflicts, poor parent-child communication; criticism, low parental support/attention, or overprotection. Cyber-victims: authoritarian or negligent parents; family conflicts, low parental support, distant parents, negative emotional bonding with parents. Bullies: authoritarian, punitive or permissive parents; dysfunctional homes, parental conflicts, domestic violence; rejection, criticism, and little parental affection. Cyberbullies: authoritarian, negligent or permissive parents, and family conflicts. Protective factors: democratic, balanced parents; no domestic conflicts, family cohesion, quality interactions, easy parentchild communication, parents support and care for their children, close-knit relationships, and foster secure attachment. Conclusion. Some family variables may be relevant, although the probability of becoming a victim or aggressor of bullying and cyberbullying may be influenced by other factors.},

Therefore, this study had two aims: (1) to study the prevalence of bullying/cyberbullying in fifth and sixth grade of primary school; and (2) to explore the level of victimization, perpetration and observed behavior among students in fifth and sixth grade of elementary school. 1,993 students from the Basque Country (51.5\% fifth-graders, 48.5\% sixth-graders) participated. The "Cyberbullying. Screening of Peer Harassment” test was administered. The results revealed that: (1) a significantly higher percentage of bully/victims was found in fifth grade, no differences were found for pure-victims, pure-bullies and bystanders as a function of age; (2) a higher percentage of pure-cybervictims, pure-cyberaggresors, cyberbully/victims and cyberobservers was found in sixth grade; (3) face-to-face victimization and aggression was greater in fifth grade (4) cybervictimization and cyberobservation was significantly higher in sixth grade. These data emphasize the importance of implementing programs to prevent bullying/cyberbullying at this stage},

These risks have been studied individually or through associations of some of them but they have not been explored conjointly. The main objective is to determine the comorbidity between the described Internet risks and to identify the profiles of victimized adolescents. An analytical and cross-sectional study with 3212 participants (46.3\% males) from 22 Spanish schools was carried out. Mean age was 13.92 ± 1.44 years (range 11–21). Assessment tools with adequate standards of reliability and validity were used. The main results indicate that the most prevalent single risk is cyberbullying victimization (30.27\%). The most prevalent two-risk associations are cyberbullying-online grooming (12.61\%) and cyberbullying-sexting (5.79\%). The three-risk combination of cyberbullying-sexting-grooming (7.12\%) is highlighted, while 5.49\% of the adolescents present all the risks. In addition, four profiles are distinguished, with the profile Sexualized risk behaviour standing out, with high scores in grooming and sexting and low scores in the rest of the risks. Determining the comorbidity of risks is useful for clinical and educational interventions, as it can provide information about additional risks.},

More recently, the Internet has exacerbated the problem with online casinos, poker, and sports betting. However, there is little evidence of this problem, and we know of no diagnostic questionnaire. The main objectives of this study were to develop the Online Gambling Disorder Questionnaire (OGD-Q) for adolescents, evaluate its main psychometric properties, and establish diagnostic criteria to differentiate pathological from non-pathological online gamblers. We conducted a study in 16 schools across seven regions of Spain, sampling 2691 adolescents, 883 of whom had reported some online gambling experience. Of those, 602 were boys (68.2\%) and 281 were girls (31.8\%) Sampling was non-probabilistic and incidental. Mean age and standard deviation were 14.25 ± 1.55 (11–19 years). Confirmatory factor analysis yielded a one-dimensional model with a good fit. The reliability indicators were satisfactory ({\textgreater}0.94). The scores on the OGD-Q were related to other constructs, such as Internet gaming disorder, problematic Internet use, and nomophobia. Participants classified as having problems or being at risk of online gambling disorder presented significantly more stress, anxiety, and depression. Participants categorized as having online gambling disorder comprised 0.89\% (n = 24) of the total sample and 2.71\% of those who have gambled at some time. We discuss these findings and their practical implications in this article and propose future lines of research.},

Latent class analyses indicated the existence of five classes related to the probability of endorsing Internet risks: No risk (60.75\%), only cyberbullying (25.5\%), cyberbullying and cyberdating abuse (6.7\%), all risks (4.3\%), and sexual risk (2.9\%). Three mindfulness facets, namely, acting with awareness, nonreacting, and nonjudging, were associated with all the classes of risks. This association was partially explained by the degree of exposure to antisocial content in the media and risk perception. Finally, membership in the Internet-risk classes was associated with a lower HRQL.},

The results of the analyses of variance (MANOVA-ANOVA) and correlational analyses showed that: (1) students who had higher scores in victimization and perpetration of bullying/cyberbullying had significantly high levels of stress and many EBPs; (2) participants who had higher scores in victimization/cybervictimization and perpetration of bullying obtained higher scores in all the dimensions of stress, while those who had higher scores in cyberaggression only showed higher school stress; (3) students who had higher scores in victimization/cybervictimization manifested internalizing and externalizing EBPs, whereas those who had higher scores in perpetration of bullying/cyberbullying had fewer internalizing problems; and (4) children who obtained higher scores in victimization and perpetration of bullying/cyberbullying had received psychological counseling significantly more frequently in the past year than those who had lower scores in indicators of bullying/cyberbullying. The importance of preventing/intervening in bullying situations to reduce psychopathological problems is emphasized in the discussion.},

	abstract = {Bullying is a worrisome reality due to its harmful consequences. Although many constructs have been associated with bullying victimization and aggressive behavior, its relationship both with loneliness and personality has received little attention. The main objective of this study is to identify differences in bullying victimization and aggressive behavior scores based on a typology of personality and loneliness profiles. Six hundred and four middle school students (54\% female) from the province of Leon (Spain), aged between 12 and 15 (Mage = 13.3 ± 1.12), completed the Eysenck Junior Personality Inventory, the Loneliness Scales, the Bullying Victimization Scale, and the Short Aggression Questionnaire. Correlations, linear regressions, and latent profile analysis (LPA) were performed. Age (β = − 0.90, p {\textless} 0.001), peer loneliness (β = 0.70, p {\textless} 0.001), isolation (β = 0.18, p {\textless} 0.001), neuroticism (β = 0.06, p = 0.048), and psychoticism (β = 0.06, p = 0.026) predicted bullying victimization. Moreover, the LPA distinguished five distinct profiles based on the loneliness and personality subscales. The disruptive and peer-alienated profiles obtained the highest scores in bullying victimization, and the former also had the highest aggression scores. Loneliness and personality are closely linked to victimization and aggressive behavior. It is crucial for health and school communities to identify and address these vulnerabilities for the prevention of bullying victimization and aggression.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The distinguishing characteristics of gifted students can leave them vulnerable to being bullied. Evidence on school violence and gifted students is scarce and it has still not been explored in Spain. The aim is to establish the prevalence of bullying among gifted students, its distribution across the different roles and its relationship with other psychological variables. Method: We employed a cross-sectional and analytic study of 285 gifted students (Mage = 11.77; SD = 2.28; range 9–18) from all over Spain (175 male, 61.6\%). The Spanish versions of the European Bullying Intervention Project Questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales-21, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List and KIDSCREEN-10 were used. Results: 50.9\% is involved in bullying, with 36.9\% being victims, 1.1\% bullies, and 10.2\% bully-victims. Bully-victims and victims present worse health-related quality of life scores (p {\textless} .001), depression (p {\textless} .001), stress (p {\textless} .001) and, and anxiety (p {\textless} .001) than uninvolved individuals. Discussion: This paper provides empirical evidence of the high prevalence of victimization among gifted Spanish students. Being a victim or bully-victims has an impact on psychological wellbeing and, particularly, on health-related quality of life, stress, anxiety, and depression.},

In the Spanish context, it is unexplored. The main goal of this work is to determine the prevalence of cyberbullying, its distribution in the different roles, and its relationship with other psychological variables. A cross-sectional study was performed with 255 gifted students (M = 11.88 years, SD = 2.28 years) in Spain (155 males, 60.8\%). We used the cyberbullying test and the Spanish versions of the DASS-21, ISEL, KIDSCREEN-10, and the SWLS. The results indicate that 25.1\% of the students are pure-cybervictims, 3.9\% pure-cyberbullies, and 6.6\% cyberbully-victims. Pure-cybervictims and cyberbully-victims present worse scores (p {\textless} 0.001) in health-related quality of life, depression, life satisfaction and stress than the uninvolved individuals. The results suggest that the gifted sample presents more cybervictimization and less cyberbullying than observed in other studies of the general population.},

This new tool allows researchers to triangulate and flexibly investigate the three main roles in school bullying, obtaining seven potential roles (pure victim, pure bully, pure bystander, bully/victim, victim/bystander, bully/bystander, and bully/victim/bystander). The sample was 2,068 adolescents and young adults aged 11–19 years (Mage = 14.2 ± 1.48 years old; 53.8\% females). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit for the three‐related‐factor model and adequate reliability (ω {\textgreater} 0.91) in all dimensions. About 28.2\% of the sample reported victimization; of whom only 2.9\% were pure victims, 15.1\% were victim/bystanders, and 9.8\% were involved in all three roles (bully/victim/bystanders). Only 0.8\% played the role of a pure bully, and 0.4\% were bully/victims. The most prevalent profile was that of pure bystander (30\%). These results are discussed in light of their importance for the interpretation of the prevalence of traditional bullying, and their implications for bullying assessments and interventions.},

Using a vignette study, we examine adolescent girls’ attitudes toward media (journalists’) and public (readers’) bashing of a generally disliked celebrity (Miley Cyrus) and a generally liked celebrity (Selena Gomez). All participants read an identical negative news story (media bashing) and two related negative reader comments (public bashing). Participants were randomly assigned to read this information about either Miley Cyrus or Selena Gomez. Results of a mixed-design ANOVA showed that the girls had less negative attitudes toward media bashing compared with public bashing. Moreover, they more easily accepted the bashing of a disliked celebrity than the bashing of a liked celebrity.},

Despite this research area’s increasing relevance, most research into cyberbullying in the present day has focused only on adolescents. However, given the long-lasting effects of victimization, it is necessary to understand its prevalence throughout the different educational stages of students. This study aims to clarify the prevalence of bullying and cyberbullying among students in the 5th and 6th grades. A sample of 1,993 (Mage = 10.68, SD = 0.71; range 9–13) students completed the “Cyberbullying: Screening of Peer-Harassment” test. The results reveal that 20.3\% (n = 404) were pure victims, 6.1\% (n = 121) pure bullies, 23.9\% (n = 476) bully-victims, and 28.9\% (n = 575) pure bystanders of bullying. With respect to cyberbullying, 13.4\% (n = 267) were pure cybervictims, 0.7\% (n = 13) pure cyberbullies, 3.1\% cyberbully-victims (n = 62), and 25.6\% (n = 510) pure cyberbystanders. In addition, the results reveal that verbal aggression and offensive or insulting messages were the most prevalent forms of aggression in bullying and cyberbullying, respectively. 36.6\% of the sample had suffered verbal aggression and 8.4\% had received offending or insulting messages. These data show that bullying and cyberbullying are considerably prevalent in this educational stage.},

Adolescents indicated what their peers, parents, and favorite celebrities think of celebrity bashing (injunctive norms) and whether they engage in it (descriptive norms). The adolescents also indicated how often they had participated in negative online behavior toward celebrities and peers. The results revealed that compared with injunctive norms, descriptive norms are better predictors of adolescents’ negative online behavior toward celebrities. Focusing on the different role models, the impact of peers was the strongest for both mild and severe forms of celebrity aggression. Moreover, the results showed that adolescents who engage in negative online behavior directed at celebrities are likely to do the same regarding peers.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a well-known construct that refers to a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. Its relationship with multiple forms of violence, including bullying, has been widely explored, but this is not the case for cyberbullying. The main objective is to analyze how HRQoL varies depending on the role played in cyberbullying, its temporal stability, and gender and age differences.
Method: An analytical and longitudinal study was conducted at two temporal moments. At Time 1 (December 2015), 920 Spanish students aged between 11 and 18 years participated (Mage = 13.36, SD = 1.83: 48.9\% boys and 51.1\% girls). At Time 2 (April 2016), there were 313 participants (Mage 12.81 years, SD = 1.59: 53.4\% boys and 46.6\% girls). We used the Cyberbullying Test (technological scale) and the Spanish version of the KIDSCREEN-52.
Results: Cybervictims and cyberbully–victims present worse scores in all dimensions of the KIDSCREEN-52 (p {\textless} .001), compared to cyberbystanders or uninvolved individuals. There are gender differences only in cyberaggression and cyberbystanding. There are significant inverse correlations between all the dimensions of the KIDSCREEN-52 and cybervictimization, with Bullying (r = − .603, p {\textless} .001), Mood (r = − .329, p {\textless} .001), and School environment (r = − .327, p {\textless} .001) being particularly relevant. There were statistically significant differences between T1 and T2 for cyberbystanding (lower scores at T2).
Conclusion: Cybervictims and cyberbully–victims have worse quality of life in all the dimensions than uninvolved individuals, especially in Psychological well-being, School environment, and Bullying.},

El diseño de la investigacion fue cuasi-experimental de caso unico.

Al inicio del curso escolar se administro una evaluacion pretest, aplicando el test Cyberbullying, un screening de acoso entre iguales (Garaigordobil, 2013) junto con otros instrumentos para medir variables socio-emocionales (conducta social, estrategias de resolucion de conflictos, autoestima, empatia). Posteriormente, se administro Cyberprogram 2.0 (Garaigordobil \& Martinez-Valderrey, 2014a) un programa grupal que consistio en realizar una sesion de intervencion semanal de una hora de duracion durante un curso escolar. Finalmente, se llevo a cabo la evaluacion postest administrando la misma bateria de evaluacion que en el pretest. Los resultados mostraron que Martin en la fase pretest tenia altas puntuaciones en perpetracion de bullying y cyberbullying, altos niveles de agresividad impulsiva/premeditada, alta utilizacion de estrategias agresivas de resolucion de conflictos, un nivel medio de autoestima y muy baja empatia. Despues de realizar Cyberprogram 2.0. Martin disminuyo significativamente el nivel de perpetracion de bullying/cyberbullying, su agresividad, redujo el uso de estrategias agresivas para resolver problemas interpersonales y mostro un nivel medio de empatia. El estudio evidencia la eficacia de un programa de intervencion grupal en la reduccion de la violencia entre iguales de los perpetradores.},

	abstract = {The study had two goals: (1) to explore the relations between self-assessed childhood depression and other adaptive and clinical variables (2) to identify predictor variables of childhood depression. Participants were 420 students aged 7–10 years old (53.3\% boys, 46.7\% girls). Results revealed: (1) positive correlations between depression and clinical maladjustment, school maladjustment, emotional symptoms, internalizing and externalizing problems, problem behaviors, emotional reactivity, and childhood stress; and (2) negative correlations between depression and personal adaptation, global self-concept, social skills, and resilience (sense of competence and affiliation). Linear regression analysis including the global dimensions revealed 4 predictors of childhood depression that explained 50.6\% of the variance: high clinical maladjustment, low global self-concept, high level of stress, and poor social skills. However, upon introducing the sub-dimensions, 9 predictor variables emerged that explained 56.4\% of the variance: many internalizing problems, low family self-concept, high anxiety, low responsibility, low personal self-assessment, high social stress, few aggressive behaviors toward peers, many health/psychosomatic problems, and external locus of control. The discussion addresses the importance of implementing prevention programs for childhood depression at early ages.},

	abstract = {The family can be a protective/risk factor for violence. The study analyzes differences in family variables (parental stress, parental competence and parenting styles) among severe student victims, aggressors, cybervictims, and cyberaggressors (who have very frequently suffered or carried out bullying/cyberbullying behaviors in the past year) and those who have neither suffered nor carried out any aggressive behavior or only occasionally. Method: Participants were 1,993 students in the 5th-6th grade (9-13 years old). Results: Victims and aggressors of bullying had parents with higher levels of parental stress, who used more authoritarian educational styles (low affection, coercive discipline, high control), and more permissive practices (high affection/overprotection, low demand/control); parents of aggressors also had a lower level of parental competence. Cybervictims had parents with higher parental stress who used more permissive educational styles. Cyberaggressors had parents with a low level of parental competence. Conclusions: The family context is relevant for bullying/cyberbullying, but family variables have more influence on bullying than on cyberbullying.},

	abstract = {El estudio tuvo como objetivo realizar la adaptacion española de un instrumento que mide las estrategias que se utilizan para resolver conflictos (Conflictalk). La muestra fue de 2283 adolescentes del Pais Vasco, España (50.5\% varones, 49.5\% mujeres), de 12 a 17 años. Con un diseño descriptivo, comparativo y correlacional se administraron 8 instrumentos de evaluacion. Los resultados evidenciaron alta consistencia interna. Los analisis de varianza confirmaron que las mujeres tienen puntuaciones superiores en estrategias cooperativas y pasivas de resolucion de conflictos, y los varones en agresivas. De 12 a 17 años el uso de las estrategias fue similar. Las coeficientes de correlacion sugieren que los adolescentes que utilizan muchas estrategias cooperativas tienen altos niveles de empatia, inteligencia emocional, extraversion, apertura, amabilidad y responsabilidad, mientras que aquellos que utilizan muchas estrategias agresivas tiene baja empatia, baja autoestima, alta inestabilidad emocional, baja amabilidad, baja responsabilidad, muchas conductas antisociales, altas puntuaciones en victimizacion y perpetracion de bullying y cyberbullying, muchos problemas escolares y baja adaptacion social. El estudio aporta fiabilidad y validez a la adaptacion española del Conflictalk.},
