  abstract = {The prevalence of bullying/cyberbullying has been well established globally. However, identifying its onset and prevalence at an early age is necessary for prevention. Therefore, this study had two aims: (1) to study the prevalence of bullying/cyberbullying in fifth and sixth grade of primary school; and (2) to explore the level of victimization, perpetration and observed behavior among students in fifth and sixth grade of elementary school. 1,993 students from the Basque Country (51.5% fifth-graders, 48.5% sixth-graders) participated. The Cyberbullying. Screening of Peer Harassment‚Äù test was administered. The results revealed that: (1) a significantly higher percentage of bully/victims was found in fifth grade, no differences were found for pure-victims, pure-bullies and bystanders as a function of age; (2) a higher percentage of pure-cybervictims, pure-cyberaggresors, cyberbully/victims and cyberobservers was found in sixth grade; (3) face-to-face victimization and aggression was greater in fifth grade (4) cybervictimization and cyberobservation was significantly higher in sixth grade. These data emphasize the importance of implementing programs to prevent bullying/cyberbullying at this stage},
