  abstract = {Introduction: The distinguishing characteristics of gifted students can leave them vulnerable to being bullied. Evidence on school violence and gifted students is scarce and it has still not been explored in Spain. The aim is to establish the prevalence of bullying among gifted students, its distribution across the different roles and its relationship with other psychological variables. Method: We employed a cross-sectional and analytic study of 285 gifted students (Mage = 11.77; SD = 2.28; range 9â€“18) from all over Spain (175 male, 61.6%). The Spanish versions of the European Bullying Intervention Project Questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales-21, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List and KIDSCREEN-10 were used. Results: 50.9% is involved in bullying, with 36.9% being victims, 1.1% bullies, and 10.2% bully-victims. Bully-victims and victims present worse health-related quality of life scores (p \textless .001), depression (p \textless .001), stress (p \textless .001) and, and anxiety (p \textless .001) than uninvolved individuals. Discussion: This paper provides empirical evidence of the high prevalence of victimization among gifted Spanish students. Being a victim or bully-victims has an impact on psychological wellbeing and, particularly, on health-related quality of life, stress, anxiety, and depression.},
