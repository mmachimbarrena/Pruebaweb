abstract = "This study explores the psychometric properties of the Cyberbullying Triangulation Questionnaire (CTQ), which measures and triangulates the roles of cybervictimization, cyberaggression, and cyberbystanding. The study sample was composed of 5,036 Spanish students with a mean age of 14.19 years (SD = Æ1.7; range = 10–23 years). Conﬁrmatory factor analysis of the three correlated-factor model yielded a high goodness of ﬁt. Reliability as measured by Omega coefﬁcients was adequate (\textgreater0.94). The measurement model was invariant for the two age groups (10–14 years and 15–23 years). Cybervictimization and cyberaggression correlated with ofﬂine victimization and aggression (r = 0.49; p \textless 0.001; r = 0.57; p \textless 0.001, respectively). The results show that the most prevalent cyberbystanding subrole was that of the Defender of the Victim (54.6%), and that cyberaggression and cyberbystanding were more prevalent among male adolescents (p \textless 0.001). The lack of parental control over children’s use of the mobile phone was associated with cyberaggression (p \textless 0.001)."
