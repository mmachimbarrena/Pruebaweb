abstract = "Nomophobia is a situational phobia leading to a deep, irrational, and disproportionate fear of not being able to use the smartphone. An instrumental study on the Spanish version of the Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q) was carried out. The objectives were: 1) To analyse its factor structure and reliability; 2) to test for the invariance of sex and age groups, and 3) to obtain specific cut-off points by sex and age non-existent to date. Sampling was incidental and non-probabilistic with 5012 participants (57.9%, females) aged 12-24 years (M = 18.04, SD = 3.3). The confirmatory factor analysis revealed a hierarchical model with four correlated factors explained by a general second-order factor. The internal validity and reliability values of the NMP-Q dimensions are satisfactory, ranging between .78, .85, .86, and .92 (Omega w). A multigroup analysis confirmed the invariance across sex and age groups. Building on the NMP-Q scores, we calculated 3 cut-off points using percentiles 15th, 80th and 95th (unnomophobic, at risk of nomophobia, and nomophobic). Females aged 12-15 years had the highest nomophobic scores. We can conclude that the proposed sex and age cut-off points will allow us to better identify nomophobic problems from a clinical point of view."
